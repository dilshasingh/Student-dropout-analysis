Student retention and academic success are crucial indicators for 
educational institutions to improve learning outcomes and reduce dropout 
rates. With the growing availability of student data, machine learning (ML) 
models provide a valuable tool for predicting student dropout and 
academic success. This study leverages structured data, including 
demographic details, academic performance, and socio-economic factors, 
to build predictive models that classify students into Dropout, Enrolled, and 
Graduate categories. Key features such as age, grades, attendance, and 
financial support were analyzed to enhance model accuracy. The proposed 
approach addresses challenges like imbalanced data and model 
interpretability, offering actionable insights for institutions to implement 
early intervention strategies and improve student success.
